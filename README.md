# OKX-BNB-KUCN-Cross_Platform-Arbitrage-Trading-Bot
My first attempt at creating a profitable and automated cross-platform(x3) automated arbitrage opportunity finder and trading bot. Any and all advice, help, assistance, forking ,etc. is very much welcomed and needed. With a little work on a few aspects such as fee rate calculations, I think this thing could really work. This thing has good bones :)

_**Unfortunately, even with the correct .env configurations, the current code will not successfully execute trades.**_

**Here are the primary reasons:**
**Incomplete Fee Calculation:** The cal_triangular_arb_surface_rate function, which is responsible for determining if a profitable arbitrage opportunity exists, is still incomplete. You must implement the accurate fee calculation logic for each exchange and for each leg of the triangular arbitrage trade.
**Rollback Logic:** The code has placeholders for rollback logic in the execute_arbitrage function, but this logic is not implemented. If one of the trades in the sequence fails, you need a way to reverse or unwind the previous successful trades to minimize potential losses. This is a complex part of arbitrage bot development.
**Potential Order Size and Funds Issues:** The code currently assumes that you have sufficient funds in the starting currency (swap_1) to execute the first trade. However, there are no checks to ensure that the subsequent exchanges have enough liquidity to fill the orders for the second and third trades at the desired prices.
**Order Status Monitoring:** While the code has order timeout handling, it does not have complete order status monitoring. You need to implement logic to:
Continuously check if orders are filled, partially filled, or canceled.
Handle partial fills (adjust subsequent trade sizes).
Handle canceled orders (potentially retry or adjust the strategy).

**Recommendations:**
**Focus on Fee Calculation:** Accurate fee calculation is the most critical aspect of an arbitrage bot. Get the correct fee rates from each exchange (considering your fee tier) and apply them precisely in the cal_triangular_arb_surface_rate function.
**Implement Rollback Logic:** Develop a strategy and code for rolling back trades if any part of the arbitrage sequence fails.
Add Order Size and Liquidity Checks: Before placing each order, check the order books of the relevant exchanges to ensure sufficient liquidity is available at your desired prices. Adjust order sizes accordingly.
**Implement Order Status Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the status of placed orders and handle different order states (filled, partially filled, canceled).

**Testing and Iteration:**
**Test in a Simulated Environment:** Even after implementing the missing parts, do not trade with real money immediately. Set up a simulated trading environment or use test accounts with small amounts to thoroughly test your bot and your strategies.
**Iterate and Improve:** Arbitrage opportunities can be fleeting, and market conditions change rapidly. You'll need to continuously monitor your bot's performance, analyze results, and make adjustments to your strategies and parameters.

_Building a successful arbitrage bot is a challenging task. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, trading mechanics, and robust coding practices. Take the time to learn and implement the missing parts correctly, and prioritize thorough testing before risking any capital._
